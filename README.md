# ReactNYTimes
Week 19 In this activity, you'll create a new React-based rendition of the New York Times Article Search application. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper functions, and utilize the React mounting lifecycle to query and display articles based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save articles to read later. You will be fully capable of completing this application by the end of 19.3.
# Notes for ME
npm init, then you write the webpack file yourself
after npm install , type "webpack" in terminal then copy the path to the file on the browser
